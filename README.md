TeX4ebook
=========

`TeX4ebook` is bundle of lua scripts and `LaTeX` packages for conversion of LaTeX files to ebook formats, for example `epub`. `tex4ht` is used as conversion engine. 

Installation
------------

Clone this repository to `tex/latex/` directory in your local `texmf tree`. It's location can be found with command:

     kpsewhich -var-value TEXMFHOME

This package depends on `tidy` and `zip` commands, both are available for linux and windows platforms.

Create script named `tex4ebook` or `tex4ebook.bat` on windows. 
It should run `texlua path/to/tex4ebook.lua` and pass all parameters there.
Sample script can be found in file `tex4ebook`. Place this script somewhere in yout path so it can be called from the terminal.


Usage
-----

Add to your source file preamble:

    \usepackage{tex4ebook}

Run on the command line:

    tex4ebook [options] filename

Options
-------

*-c,--config* 

This options enables you to provide custom configurations for `tex4ht`

### example

File sample.cfg


    \Preamble{xhtml}
    \CutAt{section}
    \begin{document}
    \EndPreamble

run 

    tex4ebook -c sample filename.tex

This config file will create `xhtml` file for every section. For bigger documents, this is recommended.
  
*-f,--format* (default epub) 

Output format. epub, epub3 and mobi are supported.

*-i,--include-fonts*  

Include fonts in epub file. This may result in better rendering in ebook reader.

*-l,--lua*  

Runs htlualatex instead of htlatex. You may need to create `htlualatex` script.

*-r,--resolution* 

Resolution of generated images, for example math. It should meet resolution of target devices, which is usually about 167 ppi.

*-s,--shell-escape*  

Enable shell escape in htlatex run. This may be needed if you run external commands from your source files.


Configuration
-------------

`tex4ebook` uses [tex4ht](http://www.tug.org/tex4ht/) for conversion from LaTeX to html. `tex4ht` is highly configurable using config files. Basic config file structure is

    \Preamble{xhtml, comma separated list of options}
    ...
    \begin{document}
    ...
    \EndPreamble

Basic info about command configurations can be found in [tex4ht documentation](http://www.tug.org/applications/tex4ht/mn11.html), and in series of blogposts on CV Radhakrishnan's blog [Configure part 1](http://www.cvr.cc/?p=323), [Configurepart 2](http://www.cvr.cc/?p=362), [Low level commands](http://www.cvr.cc/?p=482). Available options for `\Preamble` command are listed in the article [TeX4ht: options](http://www.cvr.cc/?p=504).

Troubleshooting
---------------

When compilation of the document breaks with error during `LaTeX` run, it may be caused by some problem in `tex4ht` configuration. Comment out line `\usepackage{tex4ebook}` in your source file and run command:

    htlatex filename 

if same error as in `tex4ebook` run arises, the problem is in some `tex4ht` configuration. Try to identify the source of problem and if you cannot find the solution, make minimal example showing the error and ask for help either on [tex4ht mailinglist](http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/tex4ht) or on [TeX-sx](http://tex.stackexchange.com/). 

### Fontspec

`tex4ht` currently doesn't support `fontspec` and open type fonts. At this moment, workaround for this is to modify your source file and conditionaly include fontspec and any other conflicting packages only when document is not processed with `tex4ht`. 

Sample:

    \documentclass{article}
    \makeatletter
    \@ifpackageloaded{tex4ht}{%
    % Packages for tex4ht unicode support
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[english,czech]{babel}
    }{%
    % Packages for xelatex
    \usepackage{fontspec}
    \usepackage{polyglossia}
    \setmainfont{Latin Modern Roman}
    }
    \makeatother

Drawback is that not all characters of unicode range are supported with `inputenc`. For some solutions of this limitation, see thread on [tex4ht mailinglist](http://tug.org/pipermail/tex4ht/2013q1/000719.html)

### Validation

In case of successful compilation, use command line tool epubcheck to find if your document contains any error.

Type 
 
    epubcheck filename.epub

#### Common validation issues:

    WARNING: filename.epub: item (OEBPS/foo.boo) exists in the zip file, but is not declared in the OPF file

Delete all files in `OEBPS` folder and `filename.epub`. Then run `tex4ebook` again.
